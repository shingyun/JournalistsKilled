# Graphic

## What is it ?

Graphic is an interface for Graphic library. The idea, that exists in others languages, is to have interface available for diferents graphics libraries : don't change your code, just the library.

## How to use

For the prototype, I have used Jimp as library. It's simple, without package to install into OS.

```javascript
	// test.js

	var test = function (processorName, processor) {
		// After Processor instanciation, the base contract is the same
		// for all libraries (jimp, ImageMagick, GD, etc)
		var image;

		processor.open(__dirname + '/test.jpg')
		.then(img => (image = img).getSize())
		.then(size => {
			console.log(`The picture does ${size.getWidth()} x ${size.getHeight()} with ${processorName}`)
			return image.crop(new Zone(new Point(25, 25), size.decrease(50)));
		})
		.then(image => image.saveJPEG(__dirname + '/test_' + processorName + '.jpg', 70))
		.then(image => console.log('Picture saved by ' + processorName))
		.catch(console.log);
	}

	var JimpProcessor = require('../Jimp/Processor');
	test('Jimp', new JimpProcessor());

	// Tomorrow, you can change JimpProcessor for ImageMagickProcessor changing only the first 2 lines.
	// And use the best processor for your situation : fast, features rich, etc :

	var ImageJsProcessor = require('../ImageJs/Processor');
	test('ImageJs', new ImageJsProcessor());

```

Note that some ideas are from PHP library "Imagine".

**If you are interested in this project, please star, follow the github project, email me or others contacts.**
Graphic is under developement, any minor version of 1.x can broke features. If the idea pleases to you, you can propose to participate !

Note that due to package transfer, graphic will start from version 1.x for development version and 2.x for stable version.
